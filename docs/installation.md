# Installation

## Download

GET FROSTY: [hi](https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite/releases/latest/download/FrostyModManager.zip)

## Install

1. Locate your game's installation directory. Open the Data folder and locate the file named `initfs_Win32`. Replace this with the one you downloaded from Battlefront Plus Custom Initfs (Invisibility fix)  
__If you've already attempted to launch Battlefront Plus__, go back to your game's installation directory and open the ModData folder. In there, you'll see at least one folder named after the profile you generated in Frosty Mod Manager. If you only have folder, it's probably called Default. Open that folder and locate the file `initfs_Win32`. Replace this with the one you downloaded from Battlefront Plus Custom Initfs (Invisibility fix)

2. Extract the contents of the Frosty Mod Manager download and open the `FrostyModManager.exe`.

3. Drag and drop the Battlefront Plus download into the Frosty Mod Manager window. When it's finished installing, click the Apply Mods button in the upper right. You will see *Battlefront Plus* appear in your load order (the list of mods displayed on the right side of the Frosty Mod Manager window)

4. Click Launch to start your game. It will begin generating moddata, which for Battlefront Plus takes an average of 15 minutes, give or take depending on your PC's specs. After you generate moddata for the first time, subsequent launches will take only a moment to get you in-game. Whenever you change your load order in any capacity, you will need to regenerate moddata again.
