# Maps and Gamemodes

With Battlefront Plus, various tweaks, backend improvements, and a new gamemode result in a more diverse gameplay environment on some of the most fundamental levels. Experience a bit of old and new to shake things up and play in new ways.

## AI Enhanced

Battlefront Plus comes packaged with enhancements to the autoplayers, enabling them to play some objectives in Strike and Galactic Assault, spawn as special units, and come equipped with a wider selection of blasters, abilities, and skins as troopers.

To spawn autoplayers while hosting private matches on Kyber, press the 'Insert' key while at the pause menu and navigate to [Show Administration Menu]. Under the AI Settings window that opens, use the "DICE Bot Count" sliders to set the amount of autoplayers per team, with (Team 1) representing the Light Side and (Team 2) representing the Dark Side.
