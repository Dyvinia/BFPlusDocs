# Battlefront+ v9

<img class="no-lb" src="../../assets/community-updates/v9/v9cover.png">

Welcome everyone to another update for Battlefront+ and to the project's official website! As usual, we've been hard at work on the latest batch of content, but as classes began again, life got busy, and the mod tools got some very exciting developments, we decided to reshape our plans.  
Battlefront+ V9 will be focusing almost entirely on quality of life features and balance changes, with some small pieces of new content, as you'll soon discover. The majority of content originally intended for this update is instead being pushed to Battlefront+ V10, which will now be our largest release by far.

### New Website

<img style="object-position: 50% 0;" src="../../assets/community-updates/v9/image-website.png">

- From here on out, battlefront.plus will be the place to browse through all of the project's content, check out weapon stats, and view Community Updates. Additionally, tutorials and guides are hosted on the site, making this a centralized place for information and support.   

### Frosty 1.0.6.3 and KyberBrowser

- Starting with V9, Battlefront+ will require Frosty Mod Manager 1.0.6.3 or later. This version significantly speeds up moddata generation, making it quicker than ever to launch your game with mods. It additionally enables us to utilize certain assets that significantly improve optimization of the mods.

- For playing on Kyber, or even patching your invisibility issues, we highly recommend switching to the custom KyberBrowser. This brings all of Kyber V1's functions into one application, thus removing the need to utilize your browser to join and host servers. The KyberBrowser also includes a feature for automatically installing the initfs fix, which is essential for playing Battlefront Plus and has long been a source of trouble for new players.

### Blasters

Two new blasters are making their way to the troopers with this update.

- Assault

    - Zersium Rifle: *Exceptionally rare antique blaster rifle, unreliable due to its age. Its stats will randomize with each trigger pull.*
        - Attachments: Gunslinger & Escape Artist

- Officer

    - BG-38: *Basic, medium power blaster pistol wielded by smugglers operating from Batuu.*
        - Attachments: Light Shot & Focused Fire

### Reinforcements

<img style="object-position: 50% 0;" src="../../assets/community-updates/v9/image-detpack.png">

The opportunity has been taken to give some of our oldest added Reinforcements another look.

- Blast From the Past
    - The Clone Engineer's standard DETONITE CHARGE has been replaced with the DETPACK, based on the original device from Battlefront II (2005). Its radius is more powerful and can be manually detonated while it is in the air.

- Honorably Discharged
    - Whenever the Honor Guard is nearby to friendly heroes, the HONORABLE DISCHARGE ability will increase its radius.

- Shocking Twist
    - Whenever the Shock Trooper is nearby to friendly heroes, the DISRUPTION ability will grant him supercooling.

- The Gunslinger
    - The Nikto Smuggler's Dual DT-29 blaster pistols are now semi-automatic and have a very slight zoom-in. The POWER SHOT ability has been replaced with DUAL SHOT, which will temporarily toggle the firing of both pistols at once.

### Appearances

<img style="object-position: 50% 0;" src="../../assets/community-updates/v9/image-jangoz6.png">

- Cal Kestis
    - Purple Lightsaber: Scrapper appearance with purple-bladed sabers.

- Count Dooku
    - Duelist: Default appearance without cape.

- Luke Skywalker
    - Duel: Luke's default 2015 appearance.
